partials ham islia use krte hai kyuki ham kai bar same header ya nav ya head ka code har html file main same 
rkhte hai islia abr abr har html file main likhne 
acha hai ki use hame ek seperate folder main dalke apni html file se connect kr de jisse bar bar likhna na Pade 
same code.

aur ejs templateske through ham apni html file main bina
script environment banaye js ke commands run rk skte haiaur apni baki files ko direct html se conncect kr skte hai.
